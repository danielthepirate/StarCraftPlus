Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00001=Now you have different units in your control group, remember to use TAB to switch between their various abilities.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00002=You've built your first unit. We've added it to a control group, along with future units you build. Use these groups to move your army around easily.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00003=You have enough workers to mine optimally at your base. You might want to consider expanding by building a new base if you haven't already.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00004=You've spent all your money. Everything you're building right now will be much slower until your income becomes positive again.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00005=You are currently spending more than you're earning. If you run out of money completely, your buildings will slow down.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00006=200 is the highest your supply can go. Building more structures will not increase it past 200.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00007=Your mineral fields are starting to run out. You will need to expand to other locations to continue mining resources.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00008=You have 2 kinds of resources, minerals and gas. If you aren't mining gas yet, you may wish to construct a gas-mining building on top of the green gas geysers next to your base.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00009=Looks like a unit in one of your control groups is taking damage. Double-tap the control groups number key to immediately focus your camera on the action.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00010=You now have control of all of the units in this control group. Right-click on the ground to move them or click/press A to "Attack Move", which will make your units attack units they encounter along the way.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00011=Welcome to the Terran Dominion. You are in Beginners mode, so I will periodically show you tips on what to do and how things work. Get started by hitting the Build button and building an auto-wall, preferably at the top of the ramp to your base.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00012=Good. Now you'll want a Barracks so you can start to build units.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00013=Now that you have a Barracks you can start training units. All the available units can be found in the Train Tab. You might want to start building a Marine. Alternatives, you can upgrade it with a tech-lab or reactor add-on.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00014=This tech-lab will give access to more research and advanced units can now be constructed from the building you upgraded.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00015=The reactor will let you build basic units 2 at a time from the building you've upgraded.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00016=You've hit your supply cap. In order to get more supply, construct a new commander center or some barracks, factories or starports.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00017=Now you have more than one production building, try using the Global Rally Point buttons above the minimap to send freshly built units to a location on the map your choose.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00018=Now you have more than one type of production building, try using the Global Rally Point buttons above the minimap to send freshly built units of that type to a location on the map you choose.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00019=Factory units are automatically placed in a different control group to infantry so you can easily control them. If you'd rather use your own control groups, you can turn off automatic control grouping by right-clicking the Global Rally Point buttons above
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00020=This auto-wall will lower for your units automatically and raise back up afterwards. It will not open for enemies. Build auto-walls to keep enemy units out of your base.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00021=Upgraded your Command Center to an Orbital Command gives you access to some useful abilities. Now might be a good time to do so in the Build tab.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00022=Have you expanded to a new base yet? If you havent, you might want to consider doing so. Find the nearest mineral field and build a command center there.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00023=Welcome to the Protoss. You are in Beginners mode, so I will periodically show you tips on what to do and how things work. Get started by building a Pylon from the Build tab. You will notice it creates a much larger power field if its placed close to a Ne
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00024=Now that you have a power field, you can build inside it. Protoss buildings can only be built inside power fields. Construct a Gateway so you can start recruiting units.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00025=With a Gateway, you can recruit some basic unit types. Click the Train tab to see what's available.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00026=The Protoss have the ability to warp-in units onto the battlefield, however it requires research. If you haven't constructed a Cybernetics Core yet, you will need one to start Warpgate research.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00029=You might have noticed your units are warping in very slowly. That's because the Pylon you are using is far away from a Nexus. Units warp-in much faster when they are close to a Nexus.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00030=You've hit your supply cap. In order to get more supply, construct another Nexus or some gateways, stargates or robotics facilities.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00031=Now you have more than one production building, try using the Global Rally Point buttons above the minimap to send freshly built units to a location on the map your choose.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00032=The Protoss Mothership core is a powerful defensive unit. You might want to consider building one. Amongst other things it can overcharge pylons, temporarily turning them into defensive turrets.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00033=Have you expanded to a new base yet? If you havent, you might want to consider doing so. Find the nearest mineral field and build a Nexus there.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00034=Now you have more than one type of production building, try using the Global Rally Point buttons above the minimap to send freshly built units to a location on the map your choose.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00035=Warpgate research is done. All your gateways will become warpgates from now on and units you build from them will teleport onto the battlefield inside a powerfield.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00036=Stargate and Robotics units are automatically placed in a different control group to warpgate units so you can easily control them. If you'd rather use your own control groups, you can turn off automatic control grouping by right-clicking the Global Rally
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00037=One of your units has taken damage. Protoss units have shields which can regenerate while they're out of combat. Try to retreat damaged units so they can come back and fight again when their shields are regenerated.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00038=Welcome to the Zerg Swarm. You are in Beginners mode, so I will periodically show you tips on what to do and how things work. Get started by building a Spawning Pool from the Build tab.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00039=You can now build units. Feel free to build some Zerglings or if you'd prefer, a Queen to start spreading creep and injecting larva to help your swarm grow.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00040=You've hit your supply cap. In order to get more supply, construct a new hatchery, upgrade your existing hatchery to a lair or hive, or build production buildings.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00041=You have your first Queen. If you want to start spreading creep, select Spawn Creep Tumor and place it on existing creep.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00042=Your first creep tumor has been spawned. It will now slowly create new tumors and spread across the map. You can speed this up by placing an Overlord nearby.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00043=Your Queen just injected a hatchery with larva. It will automatically inject the closest hatchery whenever it can as long as it has enough energy. The more larva you have, the more units you can build at once.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00044=Now you have more than one production building, try using the Global Rally Point buttons above the minimap to send freshly built units to a location on the map your choose.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00045=Have you expanded to a new base yet? If you havent, you might want to consider doing so. Find the nearest mineral field and build a Hatchery there.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00046=In Axiom, Overlords have a new ability called Metastatic Growth that will increase the speed your creep spreads. If you'd like to use it, simply move the Overlord near an active creep tumor.
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00047=Axiom automatically builds drones for you, but there are times when you want to stop drone production so you can build more units. To do that, right click the Build Drones button. Remember to turn it back on when you'd like more drones, or just build as m
Conversation/AxiomHintTips/Line00048=Advanced Zerg units require a Lair or Hive Upgrade. You may wish to consider upgrading one of your hatcheries to a lair. This will give you more supply and access to higher tech units.
